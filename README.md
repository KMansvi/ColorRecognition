#Color Recognition from an image

This project is a simple color detection tool that allows users to identify colors from any given image by clicking on desired points.
It is implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook and leverages libraries such as OpenCV, Pandas, and NumPy. 
The repository contains a Python notebook (`colordetect.ipynb`), a `colors.csv` dataset with a list of color names along with their RGB and HEX values, and an image (`colour.jpeg`)file used for color detection. 
When the notebook is executed, it opens the image in a window, and clicking on any part of the image displays the closest matching color name along with its RGB values. 
This tool can be useful for basic image analysis and color identification tasks.
We can stop the execution of the code by clicking on the close button of the window or even the esc button helps to quit the execution of the code.
